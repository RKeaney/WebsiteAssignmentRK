While at [V4 Financial Partners](https://www.v4financialpartners.com/), I assisted clients from valuations to preparing marketing materials and due diligence under tight deadlines. This experience enabled me to gain exposure to strategic advisory, building capabilities to stay calm under pressure while delivering high-quality work. Furthermore, my experience in Investment Management frequently involved leading team projects, such as building a portfolio analysis report with a four-person team, which increased revenues by over 7%. After consistently preparing high-quality client reports during my previous Investment Banking internship, I had the opportunity to take on responsibility in several transactions and was asked to oversee the tasks performed by new interns.
